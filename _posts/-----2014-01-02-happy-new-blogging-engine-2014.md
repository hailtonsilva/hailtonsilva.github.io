#New year, new blogging tool.

For this new year (2014), I've decided to try something new for blog. I like the idea of version control systems, so I was looking to find an efficient flat-file based blogging tool (I've found a lot, but, in my opinion, not so great compared to my last choise). Trying all the options one by one, tweaking here, tweaking there, I've realised that it was missing something, so I was not 100% happy and in fact, having some text files associated with a flat-files based system is not at all a version control system. Well, I can backup the files not caring about the databases backup, I can save the files organized with the time and date in a folder...but this is a somewhat tedious process, so I was definitely not happy with that thing.

#Wellcome to Jekyll Hailton

Well, Jekyll is what I was inconscienthly looking for. It's a trully version controlled blogging tool and freely hosted by github with almost or even 100% uptime and completly integrated with github flow. Wow! That's sound great to me, so time to check it out.

Jekyll works based on github and his main programming language is Ruby. Jekyll is maybe a little bit conffusing to the very novice to github, but in fact its really simple. To get started with it locally, you just need to install ruby at your system, call the command line tool (gitbash), install jekyll gem and type "jekyll new projectname", change the code the way you desire and then cd into "projectname" and type "jekyll serve" to see the changes at the browser. With everithing setted up, you can create a new repository at github, commit the changes, syncronise the local files with github and see it online. Simple, free and with top notch quality.
