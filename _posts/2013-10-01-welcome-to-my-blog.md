#Welcome to my blog!

Hello! This is my first blog post since i decided to change everything in this site. Yes, i was tired with the old look and feel due a lot of reasons and because sometimes is good change things to improve them and keep update with the web trends with the purpose of give the best user experience to the web visitors.

##Now English will be the only language here

In the previous version of this site, it was built with two languages (portuguese and English), but it's not so easy to keep sites updated with more than one language, so i decided to keep just one.   <br />
And you may be wondering the reasons that I've chose English instead my official language (Portuguese), so I've some of those reasons listed below:   <br />
- I need to practice my English, and this is a good oportunity for that;   <br />
- English is the language of the web (all the programming languages that i know are written based in English);   <br />
- and others reasons, but the main reasons are those above.

##Technologies behind the "scene"
From about 7 years ago once i started jumping in web development, the web world has optimized with great applications and frameworks. Those that I have special attention usually are created from php language, javascript and css, nevertheless i keep my eyes open to the others like ruby, java, node.js and phyton just for curiosity.    <br />
For this site, i've used the <a href="http://laravel.com" target="_blank">laravel php</a>(*) framework, <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/" target="_blank">foundation 5</a> framework, jquery and a flat-file based system to the blog and portfolio section with the concern of keep things organized and "version controlled". So for this website I don't use databases, but even without databases, it's also dynamic

(*)The engine/framework of this site has been <a href="../happy-new-blogging-engine-2014/">updated</a>
