#Re-inventing the wheel. New CSS Framework!

## There is always something to improve

Why the need of a new framework you ask... Well, sometimes I find that the existing framework solutions out there are to much of what we really need to start a new project. So we, designers and developer, rather than improve the project we have with new codes, we were busier pulling out or overriding the existing codes with our codes.

With that in mind, I've started to plan a new CSS Framework in PowerToWeb. The name is PowerToCSS and it can be found [here](http://powertoweb.com/powertocss/ "PowerToCSS"). Its open source, based in MIT License so anybody can contribute and together we'll make a great Framework with a small footprint, easy to learn to the new comers and easy to scale. 

We are developers and that's what we do: We re-invent... Oh, I'm sorry. I mean: **We improve the wheels**. Or at least we try.
